How does the spreadsheet get updated?
-------------------------------------

Right now, I manually run `update_script.py` to pull the numbers out 
of `data.txt` and submit them to the Google spreadsheet.

Something like this:

    python update_script.py -e women.in.software.eng@gmail.com -p [password] -d data.txt

You can pass it in to your own spreadsheet by supplying the Spreadsheet Key (`SS_KEY`):

    python update_script.py -e $GOOGLE_EMAIL_ADDRESS -p $PASSWORD -d data.txt -s $SS_KEY

Where `SS_KEY` is the key found in a Google Docs spreadsheet URL:

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=$SS_KEY
